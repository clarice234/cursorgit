## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Cursor AI editor
- Basic understanding of Python programming

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd CursorAI_Training_Code
   ```

2. For Session 3 (Advanced), install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

### Running the Examples

#### Session 1: Core Usage
```bash
cd Session_1_CoreUsage
python example.py
```

#### Session 2: Intermediate
```bash
cd Session_2_Intermediate
python palindrome.py
```

#### Session 3: Advanced
```bash
cd Session_3_Advanced
python app.py
```
The Flask app will run on `http://localhost:5000`

#### Session 4: Debugging
```bash
cd Session_4_Debugging
python buggy_max.py
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running All Tests
To run all unit tests across all sessions:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Running Individual Session Tests

#### Session 1 Tests
```bash
cd Session_1_CoreUsage
python -m unittest test_example.py -v
```

#### Session 2 Tests
```bash
cd Session_2_Intermediate
python -m unittest test_palindrome.py -v
```

#### Session 3 Tests
```bash
cd Session_3_Advanced
python -m unittest test_utils.py -v
python -m unittest test_app.py -v
```

#### Session 4 Tests
```bash
cd Session_4_Debugging
python -m unittest test_buggy_max.py -v
```

### Test Coverage

Each session includes comprehensive unit tests:

- **Session 1**: Tests for discount calculation with edge cases
- **Session 2**: Tests for palindrome detection with various input types
- **Session 3**: Tests for BMI calculation and Flask API endpoints
- **Session 4**: Tests designed to identify bugs in the max function

**Note**: Session 4 tests are designed to fail intentionally to help identify bugs for debugging practice.

## üéØ Learning Path

1. **Start with Session 1** to understand basic AI prompting
2. **Progress to Session 2** for testing and documentation skills
3. **Advance to Session 3** for multi-file and architectural concepts
4. **Complete with Session 4** for debugging and problem-solving

## üí° Best Practices

### Prompting Tips
- Be specific about requirements
- Include context and constraints
- Ask for explanations when needed
- Iterate on AI suggestions

### Code Quality
- Always review generated code
- Test thoroughly
- Maintain consistent style
- Document your changes

### Debugging with AI
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include error messages
- Show expected vs actual behavior
- Use AI to explain complex issues

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **AI not understanding context**: Provide more specific prompts
2. **Generated code doesn't work**: Review and test thoroughly
3. **Complex refactoring fails**: Break down into smaller steps

### Getting Help
- Review the code examples in each session
- Practice with the provided exercises
- Experiment with different prompting strategies
